```{r}
# Question 1.
# Load in the libraries you need, and look at the backpack data. 
# Take note of variable names and dimensions.
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

backpack_data <- CodeClanData::backpack
head(backpack_data)
```


```{r}
# Question 2.
# What is the distribution of backpack weights that students are carrying? 
# Choose an appropriate graph to show the distribution.
ggplot(backpack_data) +
  aes(x = backpack_weight, y = major, fill = sex) +
  geom_col()

# Tried a few variants of style & content, aim was to start with the weight and 
# add other factors to make the data tell you something useful.
```


```{r}
# Question 3.
# Are there differences in backpack weight between sex?

ggplot(backpack_data) +
  aes(x = year, y = backpack_weight, fill = sex) +
  geom_col()

# Again, tried various methods to show differences clearly, some options were too
# busy and didnt show anything clearly, I felt this was useful and clear
```


```{r}
# Question 4.
# What is the relationship between body weight and backpack weight?#

ggplot(backpack_data) +
  geom_col(aes(x = body_weight, y = backpack_weight))


# no obvious correlation, no outliers, the majority are in the middle.
# if anything, smaller and larger bodyweights seem to show lower backpack weights.

```


```{r}
# Question 5.
# Is this relationship different between men and women? 
# Choose an appropriate plot and interpret your findings.

ggplot(backpack_data) +
  geom_col(aes(x = body_weight, y = backpack_weight, fill = sex))

# Similar spread on backpack weight, but women have smaller body weight and a 
# smaller range of body weights, very much veering to the left of the weight axis.
```


```{r}
# Question 6.
# What proportion of students report back pain?
ggplot(backpack_data) +
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = back_problems, fill = sex))

# I wanted back problems on the Y, tends to be nice & clear showing the difference.
# x could have been anything but year and filling with gender seems useful info.

```


```{r}
# Question 7.
# Is this proportion different between men and women?
  
  # Oops, I seem to have answered Q7 in Q6 
```


```{r}
# Question 8.
# Now youâ€™ve investigated your data separately, create plots to describe the 
# relationship between backpack weight, body weight, gender and reported backpain.
ggplot(backpack_data) +
  geom_col(aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight, fill = back_problems)) +
  facet_grid(~sex)

# Not happy with this one, gives the information but it could be a lot more 
# informative.
```
